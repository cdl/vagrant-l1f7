## `vagrant-l1f7`

A Vagrantfile setup that aims to be universal for the majority of [@l1f7](https://github.com/l1f7)'s projects.

**General setup:**

* Python 2.7.6
* pip 1.4.1
* libjpeg, libpng, and other PIL dependencies (just in case)
* ~~Postgres~~ (eventually)

**Get started:**

* Clone this repo down, and then place the root of your project in `./app`.
* `cd` into the root of this repo
* Run `vagrant up`.
